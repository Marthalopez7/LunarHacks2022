            <h1>What is marine pollution?</h1>
            <p>Marine pollution is when a lot of plastic and trash is being washed into the ocean</p>
            <h2>Negative impact of marine pollution on the sea environment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Dolphins can often get stuck in the plastic waste, making them die much quicker</li>
                <li>Small, invisible plastic pieces get's into the animals' stomach. Eventually, they will die due to the stomachs filled up with plastic.</li>
                <li>Driving gasoline cars produces greenhouse gases, which makes the ocean more acidic, and therefore, not as safe for living.</li>
                <li>In addition, marine pollution can also have negatively affect us, humans. For example:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The dirt from trash and plastic makes the water more dirty, making it more difficult to clean it, which means we're going to have less clean water!</li>
                        <li>A lot of dirty waste in a tourist attraction can make it less appealing, resulting in lower tourist income, which in tourist-dependent countries can have negative impact on the economy.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What can YOU do to help against marine pollution</h2>
            <p>Some examples:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Grab a bag and pick up some waste from the beach, so that it doesn't get into the ocean</li>
                <li>Don't pee when swimming in the ocean, and don't keep your babies with pampers for too long in the water</li>
                <li>When possible, ride a bike or walk instead of driving a car.</li>
                <li>A creative idea:start a small business in building jewerly out of used plastic or glass. There are already some businesses like that out there, but more will decrease the plastic waste!</li>
            </ol>
